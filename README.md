In my Power BI sales and profit report, I have analyzed the given dataset to provide insightful visualizations on profitability across different dimensions. .
The report includes dashboards that showcase profit distribution by region, country, and state, allowing for a clear understanding of geographical trends.
Additionally, I have created a detailed breakdown of sales and profit by individual products and product categories, helping identify the most and least profitable items
The dashboards incorporate various visualization techniques, such as bar charts, pie charts, and maps, to make data interpretation intuitive. 
Interactive slicers and filters enable users to drill down into specific regions or categories, enhancing the report's usability.
A time-based analysis is also included to track sales and profit trends over different periods.
